Using the keyboard arrows, move the object on the screen to avoid obstacles appearing from the right side of the screen. The longer you go without hitting any of the obstacles the higher your score.

##### Use Cases
* Intrusctions to game pops up before interactive game starts
	* Deeper explanation of what each arrow key does
* To begin the game the user will have to click start
* The score will start on 0, and increases by 1 as every millisecond goes by.
	* Score will stop increasing if you hit an object
* The game will go on forever, unless you hit an object
* Your score will freeze once you lose the game, and this will be your end score
