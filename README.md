## Web Design II: Course Description
This is an advanced website design and development class focusing on front-end development (JavaScript and how to use with HTML and CSS). We will also be covering a handful of JavaScript frameworks like jQuery, p5js, D3js and Bootstrap. We will be spending more time on interaction, motion and data retrieval using publicly available APIs. The class will be discussing how to create interactive websites for both desktop platforms, mobile and tablet as well as the “internet of things” devices. This class could collaborate with the App Design class to build out the designed Apps.
